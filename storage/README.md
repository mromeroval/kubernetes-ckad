# Storage

### Introduction
Kubernetes storage is a critical aspect of managing applications that require persistent data. Some key concepts and components:

- Volumes: In Kubernetes, a volume is a directory that is accessible to containers in a pod. Volumes provide a way to store data that can persist beyond the lifecycle of individual containers. There are several types of volumes, including:

    - emptyDir: A temporary volume that is created when a pod is assigned to a node and exists as long as that pod is running.
    hostPath: A volume that mounts a file or directory from the host node's filesystem into a pod.
    - persistentVolume (PV): A piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes.

- Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC):

    - Persistent Volumes (PV) are storage resources in the cluster that are independent of the lifecycle of any pod. They can be backed by various storage types, such as NFS, iSCSI, cloud provider storage (like AWS EBS, Google Cloud Persistent Disk), etc.
    - Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) are requests for storage by a user. A PVC specifies the size and access modes required. Kubernetes will match a PVC to an available PV that meets the criteria.

- Storage Classes: Storage classes define different types of storage available in a Kubernetes cluster. They allow administrators to describe the "classes" of storage they offer, which can include performance characteristics, backup policies, and other parameters. When a PVC is created, it can specify a storage class to dynamically provision a PV.

- Dynamic Provisioning: Kubernetes can automatically provision storage resources based on the specifications in a PVC. This means that users do not need to manually create PVs; instead, they can request storage, and Kubernetes will handle the provisioning.

- Access Modes: Kubernetes supports different access modes for volumes, which determine how many pods can access the volume and in what manner. The common access modes are:
    ReadWriteOnce (RWO): The volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node.
    ReadOnlyMany (ROX): The volume can be mounted as read-only by many nodes.
    ReadWriteMany (RWX): The volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes.

- StatefulSets: For applications that require stable storage, Kubernetes provides StatefulSets, which manage the deployment and scaling of a set of pods, ensuring that each pod has a unique identity and stable storage associated with it.

- Backup and Recovery: Managing data in Kubernetes also involves strategies for backup and recovery. Tools and solutions are available to help with backing up persistent volumes and restoring them when needed.

Kubernetes storage is essential for running stateful applications, such as databases, content management systems, and other applications that require data persistence. Understanding how to effectively manage storage in Kubernetes is crucial for ensuring data integrity and availability in cloud-native environments.
